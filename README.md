Deck-Of-Cards
=============

This repository creates a deck of cards. There are two classes that make up a full deck of cards: the deck itself and the cards that make up a deck.

A DECK can have either 52 or 54 cards, depending on if there are Jokers or not. Without Jokers, a deck is comprised of 13 cards in 4 different suits.

A DECK can be shuffled, where the 52 or 54 cards are mixed into random order.

A CARD has both a value and a suit, unless the card is a Joker and therefore has no value. 

Values are one of the following: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King

Suits are one of the following: spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs
